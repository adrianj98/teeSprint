TeeSpring Demo
==============

There is a lot that could be done with this but with time I kept it basic. The content is synced between the server and
the client. This creates some latencies that could be fixed by changing on the client and then validate on server. Because
of this design you can open two browsers and play against each other.

This could also be a lot more simple if the server side was not required and do everything on the browser.
